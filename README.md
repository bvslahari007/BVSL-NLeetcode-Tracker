# My Leetcode Tracker

Welcome to my **LeetCode problem-solving repository**!  
This repo is my **personal DSA journal**, tracking every problem I solve.

---

## Why this repo?
- Keep a **track of every problem** I solve.  
- Write **my notes & thought process** so I don’t have to figure it out again.  
- Practice **writing clean C code** (and maybe other languages later).  
- Basically my **DSA diary**.
