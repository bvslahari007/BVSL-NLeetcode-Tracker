# My Leetcode Tracker

Welcome to my **LeetCode problem-solving repository**!  
This repo is my **personal DSA journal**, tracking every problem I solve following the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).

---

## Purpose
- Keep a **structured record** of problems solved by topic.  
- Track **progress over time**.  
- Practice **clean, professional code style** in C (or other languages).  
- Serve as a reference for **future me** to review concepts, patterns, and solutions.
